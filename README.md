# HalftimePenguin

## Description

In this project you will add some simple animation to your MyPenguin project, like moving the penguin's wings, or bouncing the whole penguin around the screen. Or maybe you want to make a moving "background" behind the penguin.

## Instructions

1. Find your MyPenguin code on github.
1. Copy that code into a new processing sketch, and save that sketch with the name `HalftimePenguin`.
1. Think of something to animate in your penguin sketch. This should be a "smart" animation, meaning it involves at least one "if" statement, to control the variable.
1. Write the code to implement your idea.
1. Repeat the previous two steps, to create a second animation.
1. When you're done: fork this repo, paste your code into the `.pde` file, and create a pull request.

### H Block: Extra Instruction
Also implement at least one of these:
* make the eyes on your penguin blink (think about variables, if blocks, and 60 frames per second)
* in addition to the animations above, make your whole penguin move around the window and bounce when it hits an edge
